# Hex3

## Description

Hex3 is a lightweight hexadecimal dump utility written in C. By default, it outputs three columns: offset, data and ASCII, all of which can be individually customized or disabled with command line options

Hex3's goal is to cleanly integrate into pipelines and scripts with minimal overhead

## Options

## Future additions:

- File concatenation support with continuous offsets (and option reset offset per file)
- Partial dump (start offset and length)
- Output CSV or TSV
