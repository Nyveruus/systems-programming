intentions:

By default, passive sniff on all interfaces promiscuously excluding lo (no arguments), can take argument/s to specify interface/s. Dump everything to a rolling 2 hour .pcap file (headers must be added to work) so that it can be read and parsed by tcpdump or wireshark. Retrieval works by a remote system using scp

execution:

sigint handler
socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_ALL)) specify low-level in network stack and eth_p_all to capture all protocols and packets
set promiscuous mode for socket
create and set headers for .pcap file
recvfrom
should capture? accept all except from lo, if user specified then check if matches user args
dump to .pcap file as long as keep running true, dum
if time elapsed is more than 2 hours, overwrite .pcap file and reinitialize headers
if keep running 0, then cleanup: turn off promisc mode, close socket, free memory if necessary,
