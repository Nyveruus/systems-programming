intentions:

By default, passive sniff on all interfaces promiscuously excluding lo (no arguments), can take argument/s to specify interface/s. Dump everything to a rolling 2 hour .pcap file (headers must be added to work) so that it can be read and parsed by tcpdump or wireshark. Retrieval works by a remote system using scp

execution:

sigint handler
parse arguments
socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_ALL)) specify low-level in network stack and eth_p_all to capture all protocols and packets
set promiscuous mode for each interface to capture all frames
create and set headers for .pcap file
dump to .pcap file as long as keep running true
if time elapsed is more than 2 hours, overwrite .pcap file and reinitialize headers
